## 50 Projects in 50 Days

This is my GitHub Pages site for linking to each of the projects I've completed. Also, this will be done in less than 50 days.

# Project List

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/weebs11/50-in-50/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
